# Horiseon

## Description
This project is inteneded to refactor the code to make it accessible and improve the SEO. Per the client request, I improved  SEO, cleaned up the HTML and CSS, and consolidated CSS selectors and properties. My motivator was to improve my skills as a junior coder. Improving the SEO for the company will allow search crawlers to better index and understand what the website is trying to convey. A clear, concise and polished website will improve the ranking thus becoming more searchable for web users. I learned how to better consolidate the CSS code.
